# Smouldering
Code for some smouldering cellular automata

+ **FIREOX**  contains the MATLAB code for our model from the paper Belcher et al (2010)
+ **CA_2layer_HeatEq** contains the MATLAB code from an experimental CA with 2 layers: one giving the temperature and the other giving the CA's state
+ **CA_3layer_HeatEq** contains the MATLAB code from an experimental CA with 3 layers: the moisture content, the temperature and the CA's combustion state
+ **ABC_CA_3layer** contains MATLAB code that implements sequential ABC to infer the parameters of the 3-layer CA that simulates smouldering combustion of moist peat
