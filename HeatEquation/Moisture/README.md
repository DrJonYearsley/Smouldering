# CA with 3 layers

The 3 layers are: temperature, moisture and combustion state

To run the model run the file moisture.m

The code uses the SPINIT routines written by Roman Zeyde for efficient initialization of sparse matrices
The SPINIT routine can be found at

or

If gamma distributions are used then the statistics toolbox is required
